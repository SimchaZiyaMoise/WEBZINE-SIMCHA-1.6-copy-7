							To recollect is to reach back — blindly, instinctively — into whatever space memory drifts through, and try to pull something into the light. In this webzine, the focus hasn’t just been on dreams themselves, but on the act of recollection: the clumsy, beautiful effort to hold onto something slippery. Dreams resist being kept. They scatter. They fade mid-sentence. But still, we try. In the interview with a dedicated dream-recorder, and in the scattered notes and fragments submitted by others, what stands out isn’t clarity — it’s the persistence. People write in the dark, half-asleep, with misspellings and broken logic, because something wants to be remembered. Recollection is often imperfect, full of holes. That’s what gives it texture. Writing down a dream is like pulling something out of water just before it sinks. The process is messy. Often unrewarding. But sometimes, what comes back is more vivid than anything you’d make up awake. This webzine is about that effort: to reach into the fog, and return with even a scrap. Not to decode it or explain it. Just to keep it. To remember that something was there.

							Okay, interview with Anax. It's today, Monday, April 14th, 11.38 AM. Good afternoon, actually.

							I love that. Okay. Do I need to introduce me and my dream?
							
							Okay, I'll start with the first question. Do you usually remember your dreams when you wake up? 
							
							It depends. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. But I always remember them at some point of the day. Either something synchronical happens, then I'm like, oh yeah, it clicks.
							And then I remember the full dream fully, like I watched a movie yesterday, you know? Like I suddenly, you know, it clicks. And yeah, so I do.
							
							How often do you wake up with a clear memory of them? Pretty often. Like daily?
							
							Yeah, daily or like every second day. And mostly when I'm sleeping the eight-hour sleep, you know? The good beauty eight-hour sleep.
							
							And when you do remember a dream, how long does that memory tend to last? 
							
							Pretty long. And also, now I do it a little less than I used to. I used to wake up and then write them down the exact second. And now I have dreams from like three years ago, four years ago. That I kept writing in my notes because I was preparing which ones I should pick to talk with you.
							And the thing is, if I just read the title, I had no idea what the hell happened. And then I read the whole thing and I could remember so real. Like it happened yesterday.
							
							Is it like the whole storyline coming back then?
							
							Yeah, the whole storyline.
							
							Oh, interesting. Yeah, yeah. Do they usually fade quickly, your dreams? Or do they like linger in your mind during the day? Or does it depend on the dream? 
							
							It depends on the dream. Like sometimes if it's like, for example, like a really cool realistic dream, then it like really lingers. I do have a little lingering feeling in my chest for boiling a cat this morning in my dream. But it's not like, it's like a really dramatic feeling or something. It's just like, I remember that it happens. Makes sense. 
							
							Are there any habits or techniques that you use to try and remember your dreams?
							
							Well, when I got the hang of it, to like write it down. I have a feeling that it just goes like naturally to kind of like wake up, write it down. And like type it on my phone or like write it down. And also some like some period of time, I remember remembering my dream better. And having more dreams when I was reading books. Like I had like more dreams, more like realistic and like creative dreams.
							
							Why do you think that is? 
							Well, I don't know. I just think that like from reading your brain like activates into this creative state. Like imagination. And I think that it is connected to some extent, definitely. 
							
							Is like the reading books also part of why you started to like write down your dreams so you could look at them later? 
							
							No, not at all. I just was like waking up every day having like this really cool fucking dreams. And I was like, I need to write it down. Because they are pretty much like connected very much to my childhood and the way I grew up. Should I tell more about that? So I grew up in this like kind of park that is like, I grew up in like a pretty small city. Community kind of big park that was like full of like trees and like places where you can like play football. And then here we like played hide and seek. And then we play like, we call it like hunt. And then we would like, you know, kind of like run all over the place. And it's like surrounded by like apartment buildings. And like all my friends, we like kind of like one lived in this one, one lived in another one. And then like during like the summer vacation, like we were like all like gather. And then like we would like play hide and seek till like late at night. Like there were like times where like, you know, the grumpy neighbors would like call the police, you know, to like warn us, you know, to shut up and go home. And I don't know, in this like park, I don't know. It's like I have to thank my mother for kind of like giving me this huge power to like imagine a lot of things in my head. Like for example, like she always like all my stuffed animals, to me, they were always real. Like she made so much sure that they were like real. We were like besties, you know, with all my stuffed animals. Like, like with her hands called like Babaroga. They were like her little hands and then they would like run over your body, like tickle you. And like when I was young, they were so real to me. Like they all had their names. They're all like personalities. And I think like to that, I, that also went to me playing outside in the park. And like we were like, one day we would like ride our little bikes and then like pretend it's like horses. And then we're like being like chased by, you know, like the princess. And then like we had these like big row, long, long row of weeping willow trees. And then we would like, you know, pluck it and make like crowns, make like jewelry and all that. And I don't know, like I feel that that park like shaped so much like who I am. And my dreams are very often connected to that park. And also that I like in that time period, I also played World of Warcraft. And also like very often my dreams are also that I'm in a game, which is like a World of Warcraft is like an open world, you know, game. And you have all of these like crazy worlds and it's like so ethereal. So yeah, I think those things come back pretty often in my dreams.  Also a lot of weird shit, you know, but like the coolest ones are like always like me being like or either like Lara Croft or either being like, you know, like in some crazy mission, like running away. Someone's chasing me. I'm like the parkour goddess, you know, like hanging by trees, like all these amazing, cool things.
							
							Nice. Would you say they're more like surrealistic then or with like elements of reality, obviously, because you say it's related oftentimes to places from your childhood. 
							
							Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're pretty often like really, really cool ways. 
							
							Do your dreams typically include people that you know in real life or are they more oftentimes like filled with strangers? 
							
							More like real life people, but they're also, I have a lot of dreams with strangers as well. Like imaginary side guests. I also, I notice sometimes I, in my dream there's this complete stranger, but they are a certain person that I know. It's just like they're in like a different, how do you call it, gedaan, is it?
							
							Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's still, you know, it's them, but they don't look. But the body is not, yeah.
							
							It's not matching. I also have that. While you're dreaming, how do you usually feel? Safe, anxious, or confused, or curious?
							
							Mostly safe and curious and very courageous, but sometimes like it depends if I'm in like bad dreams. I'm pretty afraid. And like sometimes when something sad happens, like I had also moments that I like woke up with like a wet face from like crying because like someone died. And then like I was like sobbing in the dream. And then I woke up with like wet eyes. It didn't happen a lot of times, but it happened like twice or three times.
							
							Interesting. I didn't know that was possible. So do your dreams also then include specific like sensory details like colors or sounds or textures?
							
							I like in my dreams, I feel like my whole body and I also like smell things. I like can very like smell things and like touch. 
							
							Really? Interesting. Do those things then also stay in your memory? Like how things felt or?
							
							A little less better than when I was like in the dream. In the dream I could feel it really hard. But then like when I wake up, I remember that I had the feeling, but I don't remember how it felt.
							
							Do you then also feel like a strong sense of self when you're dreaming still? Or does it's like your personification in the dream kind of differ per dream, I guess, like who you are? 
							
							It's pretty often like me. Sometimes like the alter ego like suddenly. Most of the times it's me. I'm pretty aware of myself. And sometimes I'm someone else. For example, the one I wrote down. I was like a Chinese man who was like this like.
							Okay, we resume. I'm in a body of some Chinese who's protecting some rich man's house while the rich man is on vacation. And then like the whole time I'm trying to steal something from this like safety thing. But his like house is huge and his daughter is having some kind of party. And I'm like in a Cluedo game like all of a sudden. And like I'm all like, you know, like a dramatic American. Like I'm trying to find this like opening drawers all of this. And then all of a sudden there's like 100 people in that house. And they like find me. But like in that dream, it wasn't me. I was the Chinese man. Yeah, but like next to this, it's pretty much often it's me.
							
							And when you do remember a dream, do you usually like recall like a complete story or is it like different fragments? I think we already touched upon this a little bit. 
							
							Oh, yeah. It depends. Mostly when I start typing my dream, for example, my notes app. I start remembering like the things that happened like right before that.
							
							And like right before that, then I'm like, oh, no, actually this happened. And then like in a lot of them, you could see like actually like me like again. And like first because like I was firstly, for example, writing this. And then like suddenly I remember the first part of the dream. For example, when I was just telling you my dream that how I boiled a cat. 
							
							Yes.
							
							When I was telling you, I forgot about the part of the building boat. And then I remember the first part, which was the building boat and boiling the cat happened after that. Yeah.
							
							What kind of details tend to stay with you the longest? Like faces, places, emotions, emotions or like objects? Or is it more like a feeling that it gave you?
							
							Like emotions and feelings and like views. Often when I dream that I'm like in this like amazing imaginary world. I like really see these like pretty. What is a vivid? 
							
							Yeah, vivid.
							
							Yeah.
							
							Like bright. Bright. Colorful.
							
							Yeah. Yeah. But it's mostly a feeling.
							
							Have you ever tried to make sense of your dreams or like interpret what they might mean?
							
							Yeah. I've like sometimes, for example, there was like time that I've dreamt like a white cat. And then like I Googled. There's like on Google, on the Internet, you can find these dream interpreters. And also once this dream was one of the coolest ones ever.
							
							Should I tell you this dream? 
							
							Sure. I actually don't remember the first part of this dream, but I remember this like part so vividly. I was in the back of a cabriolet car. I don't even know who was driving. I don't know what was happening, but I was just like in the back. And it was like I was in Belgrade and it was like dark outside, but everything around me was on fire. Like all the buildings were like on fire. Everything was falling apart. Like it was like everything was just falling apart, burning, like the bridges, everything. And I was like on a highway in the cabriolet, like on the back. Like with my back, with my head like on the back. And I was looking like up and everything was like in slow motion and everything felt so peaceful. I felt like I was in cloud nine, even though like everything around me was like literally falling apart. Not that my life in real life was falling apart at the time, but it kind of like I interpreted it as like something. Even though like if everything around you could be falling apart. I think I could find the strength to kind of stay calm and stay to myself and kind of like trust this divine source of energy that like people call God, you know. But it kind of like in myself was like felt this like such peace.
							
							Oh, I can't. This was such a cool dream. Like it was like we were on a highway, we were like driving.
							
							And I was like, I remember like telling this to a group of people like in the self-study like a few months ago. And oh, it was so cool. 
							
							How long ago was this? 
							
							This dream was like two months ago or something like that. 
							
							And that is also the feeling that it gave you that had like an impact, right? 
							
							Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, I don't know, like, oh, it was so cool. Like everything around me was burning and I was just like, and there was also some music playing around. But everything was moving in slow motion. And I was just like, you know, looking up and all the smoke and everything was like just fine. And I was just kind of in there in the moment. Being like super calm, super like, yeah.
							
							Beautiful. It can really impact your day, right? So much.
							
							Do you notice oftentimes when you dream of people that you know? Is it people that you have like a very personal relation to? Or is it also sometimes people that you met maybe once and all of a sudden in the dream, they're very present.
							
							And it like maybe makes you look at them in like a different light. That happens sometimes. Someone I like didn't even know like found like, yeah, you know, I dream and we have this like crazy relation.
							
							I'm like, oh my God, I'm in love. And then the next day I'm like, oh, it was just a dream. And mostly it's just, yeah, it's people I know, people I'm close to, people I grew up with.
							
							My like friends from childhood. Like us playing hunt and hide and seek and all that. And yeah, often people I know.
							
							Has a dream ever impacted you emotionally or left you feeling different afterwards? I mean, we just talked about a dream. You just had the feeling.
							
							Would you say that one maybe was one of the most important ones? Yeah, that one. I also like each one of them have that effect sometimes.
							
							Not the Emily in Paris. Should I translate you that one? I can send you the sketch. So for those who watched Emily in Paris, I don't know if you did. For any of you listeners. Alfie from Emily in Paris is buying me the sickest bag in the world. That's what it says in caps. Not in caps, in like bold. This is right after I woke up, I see. And here is like the bold. And on this side, there was an option that you could like draw on it. And then you click and it all goes away. And you could like literally design like per day your bag. 
							
							Interesting. Also, this makes me think of a question. Have any of your dreams ever like creatively influenced you? Or like giving you inspiration for a project or something you're going to work on? 
							
							Sometimes I did. Sometimes I had this really cool dream of a girl having a really amazing tattoo on her chest. Which is like very white and very detailed. So it did give me an idea to draw it out.
							
							But it's mostly, if it is in a creative way, then it's to like write it down. And then in my head, I'm like, okay, one day maybe I will like all look at them. And like publish them in a little book, little countries or something.
							
							But yeah. Cute. I've had that once.
							
							Like I was really struggling with this project. And then in my dream, I kind of figured something out. And then I woke up and I was like, but then I was also like, wait.
							
							But I know it's my idea technically. But like it's my idea because it's created by this like unconscious state. But it's so cool.
							
							But it is cool. Of course you take credit. Then I was resting.
							
							No, of course you take credit. Let's see. Is there any particular dream that stayed with you for years?
							
							And if so, why do you think it has stuck with you? Hmm. There are a few.
							
							There are a few. Should I all go? There's this one.
							
							It's a. It's a. Thing I vividly remember.
							
							It says a dream about flowers and griffins. So basically I'm going home like in a tram. And like I exit at my stop.
							
							And suddenly everything like once goes like dark for like one second. And then I'm like teleported to this like dreamy land. And I'm surrounded by these like beautiful like flowers.
							
							Kind of like the beautiful Wizard of Oz place. And suddenly there are like some workers who are dragging a big carriage. With like this big wooden, huge wooden statue that is like laying down.
							
							I don't know if you watched The Hunger Games. When like Rue dies. And when like Katniss does like the flowers around her.
							
							Oh yes.
							
							There was like the big wooden doll or something. That was like a god to them. And they were like dragging it in this carriage.
							
							And he was like surrounded by flowers. And he was like you know laying down. And they were carrying him by this like round heufel.
							
							Heel? Heel. And I looked around.
							
							And like around me there were like all like flowers. And all of a sudden where they were going. There were like also some kind of stairs.
							
							And I went there and they led me to this like beautiful. I don't even know how to describe this. There were like griffins.
							
							Do you know what a griffin is? I think this is coming from my World of Warcraft time. This is a griffin.
							
							And they were like all like flying around. And it was also like this kind of. Like the sky went like super beautiful.
							
							And they were like making all these kind of shapes with their wings. From the clouds. And yeah it was very very ethereal.
							
							Nice.
							
							So yeah that one stayed with me. There's also this one which is very close. It says five queens are getting out on the sky.
							
							And they are playing some music. And they are vacuuming all color in the world. Interesting.
							
							Yeah right. I don't know why that stayed with me. So yeah.
							
							Do you believe in dreams being able to like. Or like that they mean something or. Do you not really interpret them in a certain way. That has like influence on your life. 
							
							I think they can. I mean not if you are dreaming griffins. And like cats. But I think they can definitely. I do believe in the. I don't know how do you call it. The paranormal witches. And the deeper consciousness. Astral projection. I would never dig deeper into it. Because it's kind of scary as well. I wouldn't play with it. Because in the Balkans. You have a lot of these women who are like, really like witches. Like for real. And it's not that I've heard like from.
							Oh from my mother's old grandmother. Like I've heard from like. People who I trust you know. So yeah I think it can definitely interpret something deeper. But to me I'll just leave it where it is. And just write it in my little notes app you know.And just left them there. Family affairs. Family affairs.
							
							Do you have certain reoccurring dream actually? Or like a theme that keeps coming back. Or a person. Or a place. Or a park maybe.
							
							The park comes a lot. Someone chasing me. And me suddenly being like. A multidisciplinary spy. Who's also a parkour queen. I'm like jumping. And flying. Oh I also love when I drive. In my dreams. I don't have a driving license. Only one day. But I love when I'm driving a car.
							I'm such a good driver. When I'm in my dreams. Nice.
							
							Do you have a. You know how there's like certain dreams. That a lot of people have. Like teeth falling out. Or like. There's certain ones that. I think are really popular. Or like really. Also for that reason looked into. What they could mean. Or like. Do you have certain. Dreams. That you know. That you've talked with.
							
							Maybe with other people. And they're like. Oh that also happened in my dream. A couple of times before. Not often. I did have. For example that. All my belongings burned down. And I did. Or for example dreaming like. An orange cat. Or a white cat. Or a black cat. Those are like pretty often. You know. Or like dreaming a bear. Or like animals. That I've heard like other people dream. Or like. Someone like. Something getting flooded as well. That also. That happened. Also I just remember the really really cool dream. That I had once. I don't know. Somewhere. I think it's this one. Yeah it's this one. But I'll tell you later. When we get to it. No tell me now. Oh. Okay. Okay. Since Serbians all try to.Should I say it? Okay. So we're celebrating my birthday. And actually. I say it. Everything is happening. In time of some war. But. We got the information. That no one will attack us. And then I say. No psych. Also this is. Three years ago. So I was. Eighteen. In my defense. If you hear some cringy words. This is not me. So. It was graduation day. We were all like so happy. And we were like crying from emotions. Having group hugs. And then we went like. Skating. Ice skating. Ice skating yes. And after that we went to like the pool. And then suddenly. A drugged robot. Starts like shooting us. And then. I escaped through the window. And just started like running. Wait. Is this the train I am? Wait. Yeah. It is. Wait. Okay. And then. All of a sudden. I get. Into. Like my father's family house. In their like backyard. And I started like. Running. Just to realize they were like all. Like. Gates. Which you can like. You can't escape. And then I like. Managed to jump over the. Over the gate. And escape. And I started like spiraling. Through like. Down the hill. Through. Through like a forest. And through. Through grass. And I was like running. For like some time. Until I found some little farm. And there were like two dogs. And an older woman. Alone. And they were like. Really deep. Into the. Into the forest. And. It was like. Getting. Kind of like apocalyptic weather. Like. You know. Like the calm before the storm water. And it was like. Kind of like. Getting in. Some kind of fear into you. And all of a sudden. We hear like. The. The people like. Shooting on us. And they were like running. And we started like. Running like downhill. Even more. To some kind. To like water. And we're like. Jumping. On some kind of. Little boat. Like self-made boat. And we started like. Sailing. Not sailing. Like kind of like. With a boat. Like going through. This town. That was all ash. And. Everything was like. Like smoking. Like. It was like just like. Like bombarded. And you. You could see like. Dead bodies everywhere. And everything was. Ruined. And they like. Discovered us again. And started. Shooting us again. And just when we were like. We were thinking. This was like our last chance. Two. Dragons. Started to. Lift us up. And we were like. Flying so fast. Up above some like. Brown trees. Which were so strong. That no one could like. Destroy it. Even when the like. The war people. Were trying like. These like brown trees. Were so strong. And then. Like. Like the dragons. Flying us in. Through this world. Where there are like. Actually. Good people. Like good chosen people. Who like. Lived. Near the water. And they like. Kind of live in tune. With water. And the forest. And. The dragons are like. Flying us down. To some man. Who is like. Welcoming us. And like they are like. Showing us around. The little town. And like. The little town. Has like.
							Little houses. Which is like. Every. Has like. A different color. With a little. River. In between them. So. You were like. Kind of like. Traveling. With like. These little boats. And everything is like. Super colorful. And beautiful.
							
							Nice.
							
							Yeah. This is one of my. Favorite dreams.
							
							Yeah. Nice. Maybe one last question. Like. Like. Have any of your dreams. Kind of. Helped you like. Process something. Going on in your life. Like. More emotionally.
							
							It did. I don't know. What kind of way. But just kind of. Gave me. Reassurance. Sometimes. And just some kind of like. Hope. Kind of like. Even though. It is still. In my head. Yeah. Yeah.
							
							That’s beautiful.

					Okay so I was in this weird version of my old high school but it was like... in the sky? Like a floating island thing, and gravity was off — people just kinda bounced when they walked. I was late for class, of course, but every time I turned a hallway, it stretched longer. At one point I was crawling, then suddenly it just ended in this giant open atrium with glowing jellyfish floating in the air like balloons. I looked up and saw Mr. Delaney (my 10th grade history teacher??) wearing a wizard robe, conducting a choir of cats. 
					<br/>They meowed in harmony. It was beautiful but terrifying. I started crying and then my tears turned into little fish that swam around my head like a halo. Then I remembered I had an exam but I couldn’t find a pencil. I reached into my bag and pulled out a spoon, then a candle, then a potato with googly eyes glued to it. The potato whispered “you’re not ready.” I tried to ask what that meant but then the floor crumbled and I fell. BUT instead of falling I just... landed gently in a field at night, full of glowing mushrooms and these huge soft-eyed deer walking around. One looked at me and I swear it said “you’ve been here before.” And that’s when I knew I was dreaming, and I started to wake up. But right before I did, I looked at my hands and they were not my hands — like, tree branches?? With bark and little flowers.And then my alarm went off. Whole thing felt like it meant something but I have no clue what. Gonna try to go back to sleep now.

I was late for class, of course, but every time I turned a hallway, it stretched longer. At one point I was crawling, then suddenly it just ended in this giant open atrium with glowing jellyfish floating in the air like balloons. I looked up and saw Mr. Delaney (my 10th grade history teacher??) wearing a wizard robe, conducting a choir of cats. 
					<br/>They meowed in harmony. It was beautiful but terrifying. I started crying and then my tears turned into little fish that swam around my head like a halo. Then I remembered I had an exam but I couldn’t find a pencil. I reached into my bag and pulled out a spoon, then a candle, then a potato with googly eyes glued to it. The potato whispered “you’re not ready.” I tried to ask what that meant but then the floor crumbled and I fell. BUT instead of falling I just... landed gently in a field at night, full of glowing mushrooms and these huge soft-eyed deer walking around. One looked at me and I swear it said “you’ve been here before.” And that’s when I knew I was dreaming, and I started to wake up. But right before I did, I looked at my hands and they were not my hands — like, tree branches?? With bark and little flowers.And then my alarm went off. Whole thing felt like it meant something but I have no clue what. Gonna try to go back to sleep now.

					Woke up sweating. Dreamt I was in a subway station filled with mirrors instead of people. Every reflection moved slightly off — smiling when I wasn’t, blinking late. I kept walking, but the signs were gibberish, and the train never came. Just silence, hums, and my own face watching me from a thousand angles. Then one mirror cracked, and only that reflection bled. I turned to run — woke up mid-sprint. Still feel off.	- Anonymous, 12.12.2024, 13:35

				Ik droom dat Sim hoogzwanger op de operatietafel ligt. Ze snijden haar buik open terwijl ze volledig bij zinnen is maar het schijnt haar niet te deren. Ze kijkt nieuwsgierig wat er gebeurt, hoe ze haar kind haar lichaam uittrekken en de wereld in. Ik sta er bij, of ergens achter glas waar ik alles toch nog kan volgen en begin me beroerd te voelen. Het besef dat als het er bij haar al zo aan toegaat, dat mij een zwangerschap veel zwaarder zal vallen.

				okay. just woke up. trying to get it down before it slips.
				<br/>dry ground. cracked like old skin. huge open field. nothing but a single chair—metal, rusted—and a rotary phone on it. ringing. echoing like there were walls, but there weren’t. I didn’t want to answer but I picked it up. heavy. cold.
				no voice—just humming, low and electric, like wires buzzing. then a whisper: you’re late.
				<br/>turned around—now I’m in a hallway. hotel maybe?
				long, yellow lights flickering. old carpet. doors half open, just a crack. someone watching through each one. not blinking.
				I walked fast. shoes felt stuck, like walking through syrup. but when I looked down—black water. no reflection.
				<br/>reached the last door. wide open. inside—filing cabinets. so many.
				a woman in a red raincoat pulling out drawers. said, you missed your appointment.
				I asked what it was for.
				she said, check drawer 403B.
				<br/>opened it. teeth. all just teeth. no blood, just clean. polished.
				<br/>I backed up and suddenly falling. sideways. not down.landed in a train. full of people wearing my clothes.they looked like me. sort of. one had no eyebrows. one smiled too wide. none of them looked at me. they just stared ahead. train not moving but the outside was—it was like the world was sliding past.
				<br/>someone whispered, you’re dreaming.I turned—no one there. whole car empty now. but I could still feel warmth where someone had been sitting.right before I woke up, a voice came over the intercom. last stop. don’t know what it meant. still feels close though. like it’s just behind a curtain.

				Ik sta in een verlaten amfitheater in Gaza. Het theater is vernield. Overal brokstukken. Mensen die bloedend bij bewustzijn proberen te blijven. De ruimte is opgedeeld in twee delen. Aan mijn linkerhand Israëliërs en aan de andere Palestijnen. Alleen ik sta in het midden en het lijkt of iedereen mij hun pijn kwalijk neemt.

				I was in like a grocery store but everything was wrapped in brown paper??? no labels, just shelves full of mystery stuff. people were barefoot and like humming?? same low buzzing sound over and over. i felt like i was supposed to hum too but didn’t kno how. some faceless woman gave me a jar and said “you forgot this” which?? scary. inside the jar were like... lil clock hands, just moving around. no clocks. then the floor turned into water?? cold, but shallow. i was walking in it with the jar and my phone kept buzzing in my pocket but every time i checked it just static. finally found the door and went outside but i was suddenly in my old backyard from when i was a kid. everything smelled like rain and cinnamon toast. looked down and jar was gone.then i heard someone whisper “you’re not supposed to leave yet” and i turned but no one was there. woke up sweating. my room was dead quiet. still is. wtf was that. - Lili, 04.10.2024, 10:54

				I don’t even know where to start, it’s already slipping away but I need to write it down. I was in a house I didn’t recognize but knew somehow—it felt like my grandma’s, but only in the way it smelled, like cinnamon and old books. The rooms kept shifting whenever I turned around. I’d walk into the living room and turn back and it was suddenly a kitchen full of clocks, ticking, all different times. There was a man there, but his face was blurry, like when you try to remember a face you haven’t seen in years. He kept asking me, “Did you bring it?” I had no idea what “it” was. I checked my pockets—nothing. He got more frantic every time I said I didn’t know. Then the house started to tilt, like a boat, and furniture slid to one side. I tried to grab onto the couch, but it turned into sand in my hands.
				<br/>I ended up outside, barefoot in the snow. The sky was pink and orange like it was on fire, but there wasn’t any heat. My breath came out in thick clouds. There were trees with keys instead of leaves. I remember grabbing one and it shocked me, like static, and then I was suddenly in a subway station. The station was flooded ankle-deep, and the lights flickered. There were people in animal masks sitting silently on the benches—foxes, rabbits, even one with a horse head that turned slowly to look at me. None of them spoke. I heard a train coming, but instead of a train, it was just a huge wave of water, and I turned to run. I ran down a hallway that felt like it went on forever, and the sound of the wave behind me got louder and louder until it wasn’t water anymore—it was applause. I turned around and I was on a stage, and the audience was clapping, standing, but their faces were all blurred like static on a TV. I looked down and I was wearing a wedding dress, even though I don’t think I was supposed to be. There was a mirror hanging from the ceiling and I saw myself with someone else’s face. Then I woke up. My heart was pounding like I’d just run a mile. Still feels like some of it’s real.

				Er gebeuren allerlei dingen in deze droom maar ik kan me niet herinneren alleen het laatste moment in detail herinneren. Ik kom ergens vandaan gerend, uit een grote stad, New York? Plots ben ik op een verlaten snelweg waar ik tussen de twee banen sta. Ik ren weer. Een man op een motor zit me op de hielen. Hij crasht, katapulteert zichzelf over het asfalt en haalt dan een pijl en boog tevoorschijn waarmee hij me in mijn rug schiet.

				Ik zit bij een koffieplekje waar ik vaker kom te werken. Het is een druilerige dag en er is niemand. Er zijn hooguit twee mensen in en uit komen lopen. Als het goed is moet er iemand naar mijn tafel komen om mijn bestelling op te nemen maar het gebeurt maar niet. Ik loop naar de eigenares toe om zelf iets te bestellen. Ze kijkt me aan. Ze herkent me en zegt dat het eigenlijk niet de bedoeling is dat ik hier zo vaak kom en er zo lang zit terwijl ik altijd maar één koffie bestel. Dat dat niet kan, maar dat ze mij mag en dus op zoek wil gaan naar een creatieve oplossing.
